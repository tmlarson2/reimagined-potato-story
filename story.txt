Last week i gave a fire safety talk.
And nobody paid any attention.
It's my own fault for using powerpoint.
Powerpoint is boring.
People learn in lots of different ways, But experience is the best teacher.
Today, smoking is gonna save lives.
*Dwight puffs on cigarette, then throws lit cigarette into garbage can filled with paper and lighter fluid.*

*looking around office to see if coworkers notice the smoke*
"Does anyone smell anything smoky?" Dwight says.
"Did you bring your jerky again?" Angela asks.
*Dwight clears throat*
*Pam points to smoke* "Oh, my God! Uh, Oh my God!"

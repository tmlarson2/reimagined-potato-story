Last week i gave a fire safety talk.
And nobody paid any attention.
It's my own fault for using powerpoint.
Powerpoint is boring.
People learn in lots of different ways, But experience is the best teacher.
Today, smoking is gonna save lives.
*Dwight puffs on cigarette, then throws lit cigarette into garbage can filled with paper and lighter fluid.*

*looking around office to see if coworkers notice the smoke*
"Does anyone smell anything smoky?" Dwight says.
"Did you bring your jerky again?" Angela asks.
*Dwight clears throat*
*Pam points to smoke* "Oh, my God! Uh, Oh my God!"

*Everyone looked at where Pam's finger was pointing and saw that the 
garbage can was on fire. Smoke came out of the garbage bin, and the light 
of the fire was reflected on every frightened face.*
